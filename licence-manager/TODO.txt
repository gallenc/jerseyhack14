rest interface
DONE make error messages show stack trace of problems in REST error response message - to see why request failed
DONE * create a licence-pub:get / list licence metadata (dont want to get the licence spec just metadata)
DONE * make list responses show full type of response message - to make select / cut paste easier
create renewal time field in licence metadata - to that new licence is created with expiry date = start date + time
look at licence options - change to numbers - and possibly add value constants or range
DONE replace rest interface delete GET with DELETE command/ and or ?confirm=true
check licence metadata includes / does not include licencee info etc

changes to licence keys
change licence keys to use ClientKeys/ManagerKeys classes (simplifies understanding of api)
change encryption of licence private key to also use public / private key

change to use Base64 instead of hex for encoding (shorter licences)

project completion

To build the licence archetype generator use mvn clean install
After Building the archetype, to create a project move to an empty folder and use
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local -DarchetypeGroupId=org.opennms \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=osgi.licencemanager-archetype \
-DarchetypeVersion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT \
-DgroupId=org.opennms.project \
-DartifactId=myproject \
-Dpackage=org.opennms.project.package
 
 Where -DgroupId=org.opennms.project  is the group id of your generated project
-DartifactId=myproject is the artifact id of your generated project
-Dpackage=org.opennms.project.package is the route package in which the generated licence artifacts will be placed
